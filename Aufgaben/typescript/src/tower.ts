/*
A new Bug hunt has begun!!!

(]]]){ <- This is Herbert.
Herbert can not exist. There are a couple of Errors that I wrote which shall never be reached.
But SOMEHOW the Error "solve: How TF did we get here?!" was thrown.
I'm happy I wrote this error, I'm displeased that I reached it...
Solution: The Number of disc is 3 while the biggest index is 0. That could have been obvious

(]]]){ <- This is Artemis
She brought me another Error that should have been unreachable. "solve: For the love of god, get your priorities straight"
So apparently two of my priorities are the same...
Solution: when the variable maxDiscs is defined within in the for loop, it is 0 with each iteration... Moved it outside
Furthermore changed < to <= because sometimes 0 is the max Disc

([[[){ <- This is Nimmersatt.
Nimmersatt is eating my discs. I suspect the move function is faulty.
Solution: If it is assumed that when the topDisc is discs-1 the topDisc must be 0 and can be overwritten, Nimmersatt
has no choice but eat them all up!

([[[){ <- This is Nami.
Nami hates rules and stacks the discs however she likes.
I mixed up "<" and ">" /again/. No wonder that Nami thinks she is doing everything according to the rules

(]]]){ <- This is Apple-pie.
Apple-pie has a wonderful error for me: "moveIsLegal: fromTower or toTower have an invalid value".
Another one of those errors that should be not reachable. It's the same Tower.
I forgot that I coded it that this is something that occurs regularly

(]]]){ <- This is Ms. Friday
Ms. Friday yearns the weekend and decided that [ [ 0, 0, 1 ], [ 0, 0, 2 ], [ 0, 0, 3 ] ] is solved and exited the code.
Solution: When I defined stack initially as disc-1, I should also have changed the for loop in run to stack>=0

(]]]){ <- This is Stack
When I introduced Stack I knew it was going to bite my back. And they did! Little Traitor!!!!
At this point I have to rewrite a lot of code... The Problem is, that as soon as I go into the second iteration,
the disc in the most bottom layer are all disregarded and not moveable. This is good for the first disc in their final
position, but bad for the discs at the other towers...

(]]])[ <- This is Fridolin
He does not want the fun to end. So he moves the 3 from 0 to 1 and from 1 to 0 in an infinite loop of fun!!
Solution: Moved disc 1 to the wrong spot, due to a mix-up in even and uneven. Changed the Modulo

IT WORKS IT FINALLY WORKS!!!!! (for 3 discs only...)

(]]]){ <- This is Fridolins Sister
She likes playing, too! And keeps the fun going indefinitely. Because I allowed the program,
to move a disc between two positions forever...
Solution: While I saw some reoccurring patterns in the solution for the Towers on Paper
(odd numbers only on even numbers, move disc 1 to tower 2 when discs-numberOfSolvedDiscs % 2 == 1),
I did not notice, thar after a disc that isn't 1 is moved, 1 is always moved next,
which would prevent the infinity loop I have on my hands.
So we have three rules:
1st: Move disc 1 to tower 2 when discs-numberOfSolvedDiscs % 2 == 1
2nd: After the disc 1 is moved, the next move is always with a disc that isn't 1
3rf: Odd numbered discs only on even numbered discs
As soon as we implement 2nd, we can get rid of the ugly prioritising and everything should work well.
When these three rules are respected, then there should always just be one valid move left.
Now it works from 1-4 but not 5 or above

(]]]){ <- This is Ikosaeder
With 5 discs this friendly bug makes a wrong 21st move, that spirals into chaos.
I think it's to do with a "Solved" trigger that shows up too late. With 6 there is an error at 64, after 2 are solved
(but the solved trigger seems to be working). Something is definitely wrong with the solved variable and trigger.
But that's a problem for future Luna, present Luna is going to go home in a few.
Solution: Former Future Luna here. This fix was simple. The while loop checks if start tower is empty. But since two
moves are possible within that while loop, the second move was done, despite the condition of the while loop wasn't true
anymore. So I put the second move in the while loop into an if statement, so that it is skipped, when the condition of
the while loop is false

(]]]){ <- This is Annoying. Annoying is only 6 years old (a minor bug)
Starting at 4, all even numbers for disc are not solved with the lowest possible moves. The odd numbers are always
solved with n^2-1 moves (tested until n=17)
